# README.md

This is the blog I'll use to journal my Pacific Crest Trail hike in 2019. It's a small project to stay somewhat tech-active on the trail, while also allowing me to document my thoughts and experiences with a minimal filter.

I'm uploading Markdown posts to this repo, generating the site with Jekyll, and serving the site through Netlify. The theme is [Barber by Samesies](http://barber.samesies.io/). All writing and photography are my own.
