I'm Jacob Leistra, the guy above with the goofy smile. That was me at Columbine Lake in the Mineral King Valley of Sequoia National Park. On that day in August 2017, I fell in love with backpacking.

I'm a DevOps-minded systems engineer that loves rock climbing and music. In May 2019 I quit my job to [hike the Pacific Crest Trail \(PCT\)](https://www.pcta.org/discover-the-trail/thru-hiking-long-distance-hiking/). I wanted to journal some of my trip, so I decided to spin up a website. I'm using GitHub to host my repo, and Netlify to serve the site. The theme is [Barber by Samesies](http://barber.samesies.io/). All writing and photography are my own.

###### "Game Boy?"
Most hikers on long distance thru-hikes pick up trail names. These names can come from mannerisms, foods they eat, funny things they say, etc.

In September 2017 I hiked the Tahoe Rim Trail (TRT), a 170-mile loop around Lake Tahoe. Shortly before my hike, I bought a cheap hat from Etsy with a purple Game Boy patch on it. I wore this hat for my entire hike and some of the hikers I met called me "Game Boy." I guess the name fits, because I hummed tunes from my favorite Game Boy games while I was hiking: [Pokemon Red and Blue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7XfFk5Ytv8&t=315s), [The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULyEY_GjSoA), and [Metroid II](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCIH943auRA).

We'll see if the name sticks on the PCT.

###### Journaling
Outside of high school and university essays, I've never really done much writing. In the spirit of taking big steps and doing new things--like the PCT--I'm committing to journaling my days for the next few months. Much of what I write will be what I'm thinking about, what I'm experiencing, and how my hike is going.

###### Ultralight Hiking
My backpacking style is to buy excellent quality, ultralight equipment from small cottage makers, and to carry only what I need to safely enjoy my hike. As many hikers will attest, knowledge is lighter than gear you'll never use. I approach my gear selection with the mindset that if I can carry less I can hike more.

Over the past few years I've had issues with my right patella and iliotibial (IT) band. Being ultralight means I can miminimize the chance of reinjury while enjoying more of the time on my feet.
