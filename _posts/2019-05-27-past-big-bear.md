It got *cold* overnight, and there was a couple inches of snow outside. But I was antsy to get going, so I did. 

We grabbed breakfast nearby and began looking to hitchhike out of town. We split into groups, and the first two groups got hitches right away. Toucan and I were working the corner for almost an hour before a psychedelic school bus picked us up. The driver, an artist from Arizona, could only drive us 3 miles. Here's a shot of the bus as it was driving away:

After this hitch, we got quickly picked up by a local who was happy to meet hikers. We got to the trail by 11:30 AM and had almost 20 miles to do. So, we busted it out. Here are some photos from the day:
