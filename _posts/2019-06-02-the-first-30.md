Mile 369.3 -> Mile 389.2

It's getting hard to keep up with writing, so this will be a short post. Today we got out of Wrightwood by 10 AM, must later than we wanted to. We had a near-20 mile day of mostly sharp ascending and descending. It was rough, especially because I was hungover. But today we got to summit Mt. Baden-Powell, so that was awesome. I missed out on Mt. San Jacinto, but I hope to come back later to get the summit in better conditions.
