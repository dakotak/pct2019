Mile 232.1 -> Mile 256.2

Today I passed the 250 mile mark as I headed into Arrastre Trail Camp for the night. The 24 miles today varied from steep inclines on pine littered dirt to washed out creek beds. I ascended most of the day before reaching an elevation around 8800 ft. The elevation dropped to 7608 ft. at Arrastre, and it's all cruising into Big Bear Lake.

The forecast for tomorrow calls for a high of 40 degrees and a low of 27, with high chances of rain/snow for most of the day. My group decided to bite the bullet and get a cheap motel room in Big Bear Lake, and I'm honestly surprised we found one. I'm going to join them if only to stay dry and warm. The crazy weather is really weirding me out. I just want a couple weeks of hot, sunny days.

And while the Sierra is looking dicey, I'm getting antsy just hopping from motel to motel. We'll see how the next week fares in terms of continuity of hiking.
