Mile 451.0 -> Mile 454.5

I woke up to my quilt soaked with condensation, but I didn't worry. Today we hit Hiker Heaven, and though I had high expectations, the name stood up. After a quick hike through a highway tunnel and Vasquez Rocks Park, we hit the small town of Agua Dulce. After a brief roadwalk we visited Home Made Cafe for a fantastic breakfast. Shortly after we were flagged down by a trail angel with a truck bed filled with hikers. He let us know we would be back to pick us up and take us to Hiker Heaven. A minute or two later, Fred picked us up, gave us a speech about how he's a stunt double in NCIS and writes fiction starring animals, and dropped us off.

We spent the rest of the day catching up on chores and meeting new and old friends. The Hiker Heaven setup is truly remarkable, and the Saufley's are amazing people.

We spent our nero and zero kicking back, eating pizza, drinking beer, and cleaning clothes. That seems to be our "town routine," and it works damn well.

The second time we went to the local pizza place (Big Mouth Pizza, if I recall correctly), we sang karaoke. I sang "People Are People" by Depeche Mode, and then we did a group rendition of Aha's "Take On Me."

Tomorrow we leave for Casa De Luna and we plan to zero there as well. The Sierra is calling, but it can wait for now.
