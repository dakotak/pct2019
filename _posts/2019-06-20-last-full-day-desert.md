Mile 656.0 -> Mile 681.1

Today is our last full day of the desert. Tomorrow we'll be in Kennedy Meadows, the "end" of the desert section of the Pacific Crest Trail.

I got an early start at around 4:45 AM out of camp. We only planned for 25 miles today, which at this point feels like cruising. In fact, with minimal breaks a solid 25 miles can be done by 1 or 2 in the afternoon. But there's no point to getting to camp super early only to sit around and read or watch downloaded TV shows.

Most of the day was unremarkable in terms of hiking, but those days are often great. Just being outdoors, smelling dirt and plants, and breathing in fresh air is rewarding enough. The gorgeous views are bonuses, but very common bonuses on the PCT. 

I finally started the *1Q84* audiobook I had on my phone since day 1. It's interesting so far, and I'm looking forward to tearing through it over the next couple weeks.
