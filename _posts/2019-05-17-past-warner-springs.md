Day 7: Mile 109.5 -> Mile 124.9

Day 8: Mile 124.9 -> Mile 145.4

We spent the next two days approaching Paradise Valley and Idyllwild. We left Warner Springs in wet, rainy conditions that followed us all the way into Idyllwild. So, we're back to the bizarre desert conditions that puzzle me and my gear decisions. I'm definitely ready for the sweltering days. 

A couple of highlights on the way: I hiked through some incredible boulder fields. These boulders looked just like those at the Buttermilks in Bishop--and many just as tall as the biggest that Bishop has.

Seeing as I'm a huge fan of bouldering in Bishop, I was pretty excited. There was just a ton of rock as far as the eye can see.

Another highlight was staying at Mary's at mile 145. She has a wonderful camping spot with water, a privy, and John Muir-themed reading material in a Little Free Library. The phrase on the book cabinet made me smile: "Books you don't need in a place you can't find."

It's the little things that make my day out here on trail.
