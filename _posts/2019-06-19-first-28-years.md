Bus ride to Walker Pass -> Mile 656.0

Today I turned 28 years old. I don't feel any different, but that's how it goes with just about every birthday. I don't have any profound thoughts to share, at least now. But I will say that I'm proud of myself at least a little bit. I'm currently doing exactly what I want to do with my life. I don't know what I'll do when I'm done with the PCT and how I'll re-enter society, but I'm not worried about it either. For the first time in a while I'm not concerned with "the plan" but instead focusing on just living.

Our plan today was to take a bus out of Ridgecrest and do just a few miles. We ended up camping just a few miles after Walker Pass. We could have easily done more, and probably should have, but we're on target to hit Kennedy Meadows by Friday, June 21. 

Instead of hiking on, we huddled under the shade, played music and chatted, and played a game of Love Letter. We dealt with ants and other bugs, but it seemed like Horse Seducer has it the worst. He kept cursing at ants getting in his food bag.

It was a chill night and a great way to spend a birthday.
