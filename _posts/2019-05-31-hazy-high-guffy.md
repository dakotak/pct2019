Mile 341.9 -> Mile 364.3

Today's hike was a doozy. We headed out of Cajon Pass into Guffy Campground just outside of Wrightwood. Our plan is to resupply tomorrow, watch the Champions League final, and get out of Wrightwood. 

The hiking, which comprised of over 5000 ft. of elevation gain, was tough. It was also tough because it was in the high 70s and sunny. It was even tougher because I pretty much are day-old McDoubles for the day's meals. But the sights, as is becoming tradition, were gorgeous. I'll let the photos do the talking for today's post.
