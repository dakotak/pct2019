Mile 534.9 -> Mile 566.4 -> Ride into Tehachapi

Woosh. Woosh. Woosh. If it wasn't obvious to me last night, the alarm clock of a giant wind turbine makde it clear that we slept in the middle of a wind farm. And I slept like a rock. But there was no time to sleep, since it was 5:30 AM and already 70 some degrees. 

As soon as I got walking the sun was hunting me with its beams. The best shade I experienced all day was in the first hour in the shadow of a wind turbine. As the day grew hotter I would have died for that shade again. Instead I just mostly died.

The day started out with a couple thousand feet of elevation gain through hills of Joshua Trees. By the time the elevation leveled out it was borderline unbearably hot. It was the type of heat where you feel constantly parched, unable to ever drink away the metallic taste in your dry mouth. The problem is that your water bottles are hot the touch, and your water's temperature is more suitable for bathing. But still you drink, and it doesn't feel like it does you any good.

It was one of those days, and the only thing pushing me was the need to refill water (in Tehachapi), the promise of shade (in Tehachapi), and a cold drink (in Tehachapi). Basically, Tehachapi was the goal. And I got here.
