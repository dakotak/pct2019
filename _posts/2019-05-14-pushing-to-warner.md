Mile 83.1 -> Mile 109.5

Against my better judgement, I followed the group of Jeremy, Beaver, Toucan, and Trashalope into Warner Springs. We pushed 26+ miles through heat and sun to get to a mini paradise in Warner Springs. This small town caters heavily to PCT hikers in exchange for donations to benefit their local unified school district.

A few highlights from today's hike: we crossed the 100 mile marker, we hiked in a huge meadow (a huge change of pace from tree and bush-lined mountain ridges), and we went to Eagle Rock.

My foot is still bothering me, but it's manageable and I plan on resting tomorrow until the afternoon before deciding on my next steps.
