Mile 335.6 -> Mile 341.9

We hiked a quick 6 miles into Cajon Pass for the promise of McDonald's breakfast, the last motel before Tehachapi (and the end of the desert), and a hot tub/pool.

The miles went fast, the landscape was gorgeous, and the promises were kept. We skirted a cliff-like ridgeline down to the CA 138 and I-15 interstate junction.

We spent the day holed up in a motel drinking Tecate and Lagunitas beer, taking a dip in the pool and hot tub, and chatting with Rick (the overly welcoming manager of the Best Western in Cajon Pass). The other four took a Lyft to a nearby town for Mexican food for dinner, but I opted to hang back and do some digital errands and decompress. When they got back, we made a plan to resupply until Wrightwood. It's essentially one full day of food, and Trashalope led the pack in planning a resupply of 10 McDoubles. This is the true definition of hiker trash, and I'm starting to love it.

Tomorrow we're ascending straight up to 8000 ft. to camp before Wrightwood, where we'll resupply in town with real food and pick up out packages.
